# lessphp port for Kohana

This is a port of lessphp for the Kohana framework. It is a simple and elegant
wrapper for a less compiler and decompiler.

Classes have been renamed for Kohana convention purpose. Also, even though less
is written as LESS, having a class named LESSPHP is definately ugly, so I have 
just called it LessPHP.

The decompiler (also called lessify) does not work, so do not use it yet.

The original work is implemented in a submodule to make upgrading easier.
